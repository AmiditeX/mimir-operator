# Mimir Operator

The Mimir Operator is a Kubernetes operator to control Mimir tenants using CRDs.

## Description

Currently, the operator is capable of:

- Connecting to remote Mimir instances (with optional authentication)
- Loading alerting rules for a specific Mimir tenant depending on labels
- Overriding rule parameters per tenant
- Adding external labels to the generated alerts
- Loading Alert Manager config for a specific Mimir tenant

Read the documentation [here](docs/index.md).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- go version v1.21.0+
- docker version 17.03+.
- kubectl version v1.11.3+.
- Access to a Kubernetes v1.11.3+ cluster.

### To Deploy on the cluster

**Build and push your image to the location specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make docker-build docker-push IMG=<some-registry>/mimir-operator:tag
```

**NOTE:** This image ought to be published in the personal registry you specified.
And it is required to have access to pull the image from the working environment.
Make sure you have the proper permission to the registry if the above commands donâ€™t work.

**Install the CRDs into the cluster:**

```sh
make install
```

**Deploy the Manager to the cluster with the image specified by `IMG`:**

```sh
make deploy IMG=<some-registry>/mimir-operator:tag
```

> **NOTE**: If you encounter RBAC errors, you may need to grant yourself cluster-admin
> privileges or be logged in as admin.

**Create instances of your solution**
You can apply the samples (examples) from the config/sample:

```sh
kubectl apply -k config/samples/
```

> **NOTE**: Ensure that the samples has default values to test it out.

### To Uninstall

**Delete the instances (CRs) from the cluster:**

```sh
kubectl delete -k config/samples/
```

**Delete the APIs(CRDs) from the cluster:**

```sh
make uninstall
```

**UnDeploy the controller from the cluster:**

```sh
make undeploy
```

## Project Distribution

Following are the steps to build the installer and distribute this project to users.

1. Build the installer for the image built and published in the registry:

```sh
make build-installer IMG=<some-registry>/mimir-operator:tag
```

NOTE: The makefile target mentioned above generates an 'install.yaml'
file in the dist directory. This file contains all the resources built
with Kustomize, which are necessary to install this project without
its dependencies.

2. Using the installer

Users can just run kubectl apply -f <URL for YAML BUNDLE> to install the project, i.e.:

```sh
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<org>/mimir-operator/<tag or branch>/dist/install.yaml
```

## Contributing

### How it works

This project aims to follow the Kubernetes [Operator pattern](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/).

It uses [Controllers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/controller/),
which provide a reconcile function responsible for synchronizing resources until the desired state is reached on the cluster.

### Test It Out

1. Install the CRDs into the cluster:

```sh
make install
```

2. Run your controller (this will run in the foreground, so switch to a new terminal if you want to leave it running):

```sh
make run
```

**NOTE:** You can also run this in one step by running: `make install run`

### Modifying the API definitions

If you are editing the API definitions, generate the manifests such as CRs or CRDs using:

```sh
make manifests
```

**NOTE:** Run `make --help` for more information on all potential `make` targets

More information can be found via the [Kubebuilder Documentation](https://book.kubebuilder.io/introduction.html)

## Releasing a new version

- Update the documentation in `docs/` (check the instructions for installation and set the upcoming release as the latest release)
- Run `make generate` and `make manifests` to refresh the CRDs and the deployment files in `config/` (the CRDs are copied to the Helm chart)
- Bump the chart version in `deploy/helm/mimir-operator/Chart.yml` with the version of the upcoming release
- Run `make helm/docs` to regenerate the Helm README with any new documentation of the values
- Check if `config/rbac/role.yaml` has changed. If it did, edit the RBAC config in the Helm Chart (`deploy/helm/mimir-operator/templates/rbac.yaml`) to reflect the changes
- Run `git checkout -b [RELEASE]`
- Push the new branch to the Git
- Merge and create a Release on Github
